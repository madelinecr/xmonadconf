# xmonad and xmobar

This is my xmonad and xmobar configuration. I've made it into a github
repository mostly for my own backup, and also so that it might help someone out
there trying to configure either.

If you really want your xmonad/xmobar install to look just like mine, just check
out this repository to ~/.xmonad and symlink xmobarrc to ~/.xmobarrc .

# xmonad and xmobar

This is my xmonad and xmobar configuration. I've made it into a github
repository mostly for my own backup, and also so that it might help someone out
there trying to configure either.

If you really want your xmonad/xmobar install to look just like mine, just
follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repository into ~/.xmonad
2. Symlink ~/.xmonad/xmobarrc to ~/.xmobarrc
3. Symlink ~/.xmonad/stalonetrayrc to ~/.stalonetrayrc
